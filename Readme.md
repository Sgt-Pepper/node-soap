This is a clone from the original  node-soap created by [@milewise](https://github.com/milewise).
For my personal purpose (easy installation with windows), I removed the libexpat dependencies and used node-xml instead (no compilation of c modules required any more ).

This module lets you connect to web services using SOAP.  It also provides a server that allows you to run your own SOAP services.
